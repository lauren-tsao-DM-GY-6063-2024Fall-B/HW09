- Mondrian Red: color can be modified by moving the Red, Green and Blue Amount sliders.
- Mondrian Yellow: The animation plays when the Animation Frame slider is moved.
- Mondrian Blue: colors can be changed by using the Color Picker.

#### HW09B
- Make a pinching gesture between the thumb and index finger for either or both your hands.
- Open up your fingers, a square or circle of a randomized color and blend mode will form. The shapes scale depending on how large the gap is between your thumb and index finger, as well as distance from the camera.
- To generate new shapes, move your hands completely out of the frame and back in, and repeat the pinching gesture again.
