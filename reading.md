## Creative Coding (DM-GY 6063) - Read & Respond: Week 09

This was a really unique reading response assignment! I recorded how I phrased my questions to ChatGPT and uploaded it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17JK_wcPn_TnF9D0Yt3BcF6qRQrG4KWKv/view?usp=sharing)

Regarding its 300-word response, I think what it got right was its key phrase, explaining how non-human photography can help us learn more about the world we live in. I believe it is referring to the book’s mention of carbon dioxide emissions. Although invisible to the naked eye, traces of these emissions are captured through the altered light and particles in photography, making the changes in the Earth’s atmosphere visually apparent.

It also established a connection between John Berger’s Ways of Seeing, in which cameras can capture things that we humans cannot see, and also provides us a visual access to places we cannot reach. However, I noticed that it did not mention any connection to Du Bois’s data portraits. I do feel that his work is related in some way, in which we can, literally, draw data from such photographs, allowing us to document, track, and evaluate the changes that our world is undergoing.
